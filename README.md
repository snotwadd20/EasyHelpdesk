# EasyHelpdesk
A unity script that makes it easy to add helpdesk messages into a game. Add the script into your project and call EasyHelpdesk.Message(string message, float time) to display the message. Allows you to link your own text object if you want to make it look fancy, but it'll make it's own damn text object if you don't.
